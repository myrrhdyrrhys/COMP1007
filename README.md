# COMP1007
Programming Design and Implementation (Year 1, Semester 1)

One of the first units in my SE undergrad, introducing me to concepts about program structure (methods, classes, etc.) and teaching me to write clean code. It also served as an introduction to Java, which I would largely use for most other programming-oriented units.

These files are for the final assessment of the unit, to do with image manipulation in the way of performing convolutions or smoothing effects on imported images (a few sample PNGs to work with are provided). For more on how to use the DetectEdges program refer the README.txt in the repository.
